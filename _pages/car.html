    <h1>Contributions</h1>
    <p>• We propose a lightweight two-stage neural network that is capable of learning a path connecting the start and goal SE(2) states directly from the environment. 
      A salient feature of our algorithm is its independence from tradi-tional sampling or search algorithms, which significantly enhances time efficiency and temporal stability. 
      Further-more, our network is adept at learning the paradigms of ground truth trajectories, thereby providing superior initial path for optimization. 
      This capability significantly reduces the back-end computational load and required optimization time.</p>
  
    <p>• We devise a distinctive trajectory formulation character-ized by a dual-layer, piece-wise polynomial architecture, 
      upon which we construct a differential flatness-based spatial-temporal joint trajectory optimization formulation. 
      This methodology is adept at not only facilitating the efficient generation of superior, collision-free trajectories but also at addressing the intrinsic ambiguities associated with flatness models, 
      thus augmenting the completeness. Furthermore, we meticulously derive the gradient propa-gation chain within this trajectory representation, 
      which empowers the proficient employment of gradient-based numerical optimization techniques.</p>

    <p>• We amalgamate the proposed front-end and back-end components to present a high-quality vehicle trajectory planner. Moreover, 
      we employ an iterative modal plan-ning algorithm to efficaciously mitigate the transitions between forward and reverse motions during vehicle ma-neuvering. 
      Additionally, we conduct a series of ablation studies to meticulously analyze the contribution of each component, 
      and comparative experiments are undertaken to validate the superiority of our algorithm.</p>

    <h1>LEARNING-BASED PATH PLANNING</h1>

  <p>In this section, we introduce the learning-based path planner that leverages the performance of the network to directly output an initial path for optimization without the need for
  additional sampling or searching. Our path planner takes asinput the navigation start \(x^{p}_{i}) and goal \(x^p_N), as well as the grid-based environment E of size H∗W, and directly outputs a path p = {xp1,...,xpi ,...,xpN} 
  serialized as a sequence of multiple state points. Here, the resolution of each grid is defined as rs. Moreover, each state point in the path is associated with the SE(2) state of the robot, 
  which includes its position and orientation angle. We firstly describe the network architecture, which initially estimates the distribution of each state point in the environmental space, 
  and then further reduces their uncertainty to determine the precise states of the points in the sequence. Then, we discuss the loss function used during training, which includes supervising the network’s 
  output with the ground truth and penalizing infeasible paths based on safety considerations and nonholonomic dynamic constraints.</p>
  
    
   <h2>A. Neural Network Architecture</h2>

  </div>
   
  <p>Our network comprises three main components: the feature extraction layer, the global distribution layer, and the local correction layer, as illustrated in Fig. 1.Inpractice,directly localizing the position of a specific state point within the envi-ronment is challenging and labor-intensive. 
      Therefore, drawing inspiration from the R-CNN, our network follows a two-stage inference architecture. Initially, we uniformly partition E into Hl ∗ Wl region proposals, where each region proposal
      corresponds to a block of size H Hl ∗ W Wl in the environment. The center point of each region proposal is designated as an anchor point. Subsequently, we employ the global distribution layer to obtain the probability distribution of each state point with respect to the region proposals. 
      This step involves estimating the coarse spatial distribution of the point. Next, leveraging the local correction layer, we further obtain the accurate position of the state point based on the environmental features and the probability distribution obtained earlier. Intuitively, 
      our aim is to first approximately determine the region proposal in which each state point resides and then regress its positional offset relative to the anchor, thereby recovering the global position of the point.</p>
     
  <p>1) Feature Extraction: In this component, the FCN consists of four dual-convolution layers. The first dual-convolution layer does not alter the width and height of the tensor, but only increases the number of channels. 
    The subsequent three dual-convolution layers downsample the tensor in width and height, while doubling the number of channels after each layer. Moreover, MaxPool is employed for downsampling, 
    and ReLU and Batch Normalization are nested between convolutions to enhance the generaliza-tion performance. Then, 
    the output of the FCN is re-shaped row-wise into a size of d∗(HlWl) and undergoes positional encoding before being fed into the Transformer Encoder. 
    The Transformer module further learns the relationships between these latent features through multi-headed self-attention and multilayer perceptron blocks.</p>

  <p>2) Global Distribution: This module predicts the proba-bility distribution of N state points in the downsampled space, hence the output tensor dimension should be N ∗ Hl ∗ Wl. 
    For this purpose, we efficiently implement this operation using two layers of 3∗3 padding convolutions.Additionally, we perform Softmax on each channel of the output tensor to ensure proper probability normalization.</p>

  <p>3) Local Correction: Similar to the previous module, we employ two layers of 3∗3 padding convolutions to assign the orientation angle and position offsets relative to the anchor for each region. 
    The output tensor has dimensions of 3N ∗ Hl ∗ Wl. Furthermore, 
    we apply the Sigmoid activation function to limit the position offsets of the network output, ensuring that the corrected point remains in the vicinity of the anchor.</p>
  

   <h2>B. Loss Function</h2>
  
      <p>Anchor Point Classification Loss. We model the role of the global distribution layer as a multi-classification problem, where our objective is to maximize the probability of the region containing the ground truth point. 
      We apply the cross-entropy loss to measure the discrepancy between the predicted region hypotheses and the ground truth</p>

      We apply the cross-entropy loss to measure the discrepancy between the predicted region hypotheses and the ground truth</p>

       <p>Path Supervision Loss. We employ the Mean Square Error (MSE) loss to supervise the SE(2) state for each point along the path</p>

       <p>Smoothness Loss. In this part, we characterize smoothness by considering the path length and the total change in angle. Moreover, when N is sufficiently large, 
         the difference between adjacent state points is small. Hence, to mitigate periodicity, 
         we reasonably substitute the difference between the sines and cosines of angles for the angle difference.</p>

         <p>Nonholonomic Dynamic Loss. We design the loss function to emphasize the alignment between the direction of the line connecting adjacent points and the orientation angle direction</p>

         <p>Curvature Constraint Loss. We define the loss function to penalize exceeding the specified curvature thresh-old κmax</p>

          <p>Uniform Loss. In the spatial domain, our objective is to at-tain a highly uniform distribution of points, which is achieved by penalizing variance. Moreover, 
          we further normalize this variance by the path length of the ground truth, thereby ensuring that the network does not excessively prioritize long-distance path planning problems.</p>

          <p>Obstacle Avoidance Loss. We design the loss function to emphasize the collision-free property of paths to the network</p>

    <p>    To tackle this challenge, we implemented innovative measures to augment our dataset. Recording videos enabled us to capture dynamic UAV images in flight, 
      expanding the range of perspectives and scenarios for more diverse training data. Additionally, we incorporated a jitter to simulate visual instability encountered in actual
      flights, enhancing the realism of our training data.</p>

    <p>    Through persistent efforts and optimization, our image recognition accuracy experienced a substantial boost, with recall rates increasing from 36% to 97% and precision surging from 68% to 98%.
      This remarkable improvement has significantly bolstered the robustness of our robot tracking. Particularly noteworthy is that when the confidence (threshold) is set at 0.5, 
      the system demonstrates exceptionally high reliability and efficiency.</p>

      These charts include changes in the loss function, as well as variations in evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and mean Average Precision (mAP).</p>
    <p>Loss Function: The train/box_loss, train/obj_loss, train/cls_loss, and corresponding validation set losses val/box_loss, val/obj_loss, 
      val/cls_loss all show a gradual decrease with increasing training epochs, indicating that the model is progressively improving, learning to better identify and classify objects.</p>
    <p>Precision and Recall: The metrics/precision and metrics/recall charts show that both these metrics are high, close to 1.0, 
      indicating that the model can correctly identify most true positives and rarely misclassifies negatives as positives.</p>
    <p>Mean Average Precision (mAP): The metrics/mAP_0.5 and metrics/mAP_0.5:0.95 represent the mAP at IoU (Intersection over Union) thresholds of 0.5 and between 0.5 to 0.95, respectively. 
      Both of these metrics also exhibit high values, especially the metrics/mAP_0.5 is near perfect, signifying that the model performs well across different IoU thresholds</p>
