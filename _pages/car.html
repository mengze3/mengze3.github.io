    <h1>Contributions</h1>
    <p>• We propose a lightweight two-stage neural network that is capable of learning a path connecting the start and goal SE(2) states directly from the environment. 
      A salient feature of our algorithm is its independence from tradi-tional sampling or search algorithms, which significantly enhances time efficiency and temporal stability. 
      Further-more, our network is adept at learning the paradigms of ground truth trajectories, thereby providing superior initial path for optimization. 
      This capability significantly reduces the back-end computational load and required optimization time.</p>
  
    <p>• We devise a distinctive trajectory formulation character-ized by a dual-layer, piece-wise polynomial architecture, 
      upon which we construct a differential flatness-based spatial-temporal joint trajectory optimization formulation. 
      This methodology is adept at not only facilitating the efficient generation of superior, collision-free trajectories but also at addressing the intrinsic ambiguities associated with flatness models, 
      thus augmenting the completeness. Furthermore, we meticulously derive the gradient propa-gation chain within this trajectory representation, 
      which empowers the proficient employment of gradient-based numerical optimization techniques.</p>

    <p>• We amalgamate the proposed front-end and back-end components to present a high-quality vehicle trajectory planner. Moreover, 
      we employ an iterative modal plan-ning algorithm to efficaciously mitigate the transitions between forward and reverse motions during vehicle ma-neuvering. 
      Additionally, we conduct a series of ablation studies to meticulously analyze the contribution of each component, 
      and comparative experiments are undertaken to validate the superiority of our algorithm.</p>

    <h1>LEARNING-BASED PATH PLANNING</h1>

  <p>In this section, we introduce the learning-based path planner that leverages the performance of the network to directly output an initial path for optimization without the need for
  additional sampling or searching. Our path planner takes asinput the navigation start x^p_i and goal x^p_N, as well as the grid-based environment E of size H∗W, and directly outputs a path p = {xp1,...,xpi ,...,xpN} 
  serialized as a sequence of multiple state points. Here, the resolution of each grid is defined as rs. Moreover, each state point in the path is associated with the SE(2) state of the robot, 
  which includes its position and orientation angle. We firstly describe the network architecture, which initially estimates the distribution of each state point in the environmental space, 
  and then further reduces their uncertainty to determine the precise states of the points in the sequence. Then, we discuss the loss function used during training, which includes supervising the network’s 
  output with the ground truth and penalizing infeasible paths based on safety considerations and nonholonomic dynamic constraints.</p>
    
   <h2>Hierarchical Multi-goal Path Finding</h2>
  <div class="center">
      <img  width="480" height="360" src="https://github.com/mengze3/mengze3.github.io/blob/d329c78ee436329701cc9e32fb3e3280a55856a0/_pages/srtp1.PNG?raw=true" alt="">
  </div>
    <p>This subsection addresses the challenge of finding an efficient path for the drone that not only reaches the target but also considers potential obstacles and occlusion issues.
This is a hierarchical method that first identifies multiple goals or waypoints that the drone should reach to maintain visibility of the target. These goals are selected based on their distance to the target and potential occlusion.
A greedy algorithm is employed to enhance the efficiency of the path-finding process. This algorithm ensures that the path is not only safe and visible but also computationally feasible for real-time applications.</p>


   <h2>Safe Flight Corridor Generation</h2>
  <div class="center">
      <img  width="480" height="360" src="https://github.com/mengze3/mengze3.github.io/blob/d329c78ee436329701cc9e32fb3e3280a55856a0/_pages/srtp2.PNG?raw=true" alt="">
  </div>
    <p>This section discusses the generation of a safe flight corridor (SFC) that the drone can follow without colliding with obstacles.
Previous methods in safe flight corridor generation often faced limitations, especially in complex environments where the drone must maneuver through tight spaces or avoid moving obstacles.
I utilize a novel approach to generate a more flexible and safer corridor, which adapts to the environment and the drone's dynamic constraints, ensuring a higher level of safety during flight.</p>


     <h2>Visible Region Generation</h2>
  <div class="center">
      <img  width="480" height="360" src="https://github.com/mengze3/mengze3.github.io/blob/d329c78ee436329701cc9e32fb3e3280a55856a0/_pages/srtp3.PNG?raw=true" alt="">
  </div>
    <p>The aim here is to ensure that the drone maintains a line of sight to the target during the tracking mission.
A key contribution of this subsection is the development of a sector-shaped visible region for each predicted position of the target.
This visible region is designed to account for potential occlusions and to guide the drone in maintaining an optimal position for visibility. 
      It is a crucial part of the system, ensuring that the target remains within the drone's field of view throughout the tracking process.</p>


    <h1>Target recognition and localization</h1>

    <p>  A formidable obstacle surfaced: the low accuracy of image recognition, attributed to inadequate data stemming from the diverse scenes encountered during UAV flights.</p>

      <div class="center">
        <img  width="480" height="360" src="https://github.com/mengze3/mengze3.github.io/blob/4b73183ed170615e62c442be03e2334af1856149/_pages/flur1.jpg?raw=true" alt="">
    </div>
    <p>    To tackle this challenge, we implemented innovative measures to augment our dataset. Recording videos enabled us to capture dynamic UAV images in flight, 
      expanding the range of perspectives and scenarios for more diverse training data. Additionally, we incorporated a jitter to simulate visual instability encountered in actual
      flights, enhancing the realism of our training data.</p>

    <p>    Through persistent efforts and optimization, our image recognition accuracy experienced a substantial boost, with recall rates increasing from 36% to 97% and precision surging from 68% to 98%.
      This remarkable improvement has significantly bolstered the robustness of our robot tracking. Particularly noteworthy is that when the confidence (threshold) is set at 0.5, 
      the system demonstrates exceptionally high reliability and efficiency.</p>

    <p>The left side of the image shows examples of objects identified by the trained model, while the right side displays charts of various training metrics. 
      These charts include changes in the loss function, as well as variations in evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and mean Average Precision (mAP).</p>
    <p>Loss Function: The train/box_loss, train/obj_loss, train/cls_loss, and corresponding validation set losses val/box_loss, val/obj_loss, 
      val/cls_loss all show a gradual decrease with increasing training epochs, indicating that the model is progressively improving, learning to better identify and classify objects.</p>
    <p>Precision and Recall: The metrics/precision and metrics/recall charts show that both these metrics are high, close to 1.0, 
      indicating that the model can correctly identify most true positives and rarely misclassifies negatives as positives.</p>
    <p>Mean Average Precision (mAP): The metrics/mAP_0.5 and metrics/mAP_0.5:0.95 represent the mAP at IoU (Intersection over Union) thresholds of 0.5 and between 0.5 to 0.95, respectively. 
      Both of these metrics also exhibit high values, especially the metrics/mAP_0.5 is near perfect, signifying that the model performs well across different IoU thresholds</p>
