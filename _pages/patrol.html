    <p>This subsection addresses the challenge of finding an efficient path for the drone that not only reaches the target but also considers potential obstacles and occlusion issues.
    This is a hierarchical method that first identifies multiple goals or waypoints that the drone should reach to maintain visibility of the target. These goals are selected based on their distance to the target and potential occlusion.
    A greedy algorithm is employed to enhance the efficiency of the path-finding process. This algorithm ensures that the path is not only safe and visible but also computationally feasible for real-time applications.</p>

    <p>    To tackle this challenge, we implemented innovative measures to augment our dataset. Recording videos enabled us to capture dynamic UAV images in flight, 
      expanding the range of perspectives and scenarios for more diverse training data. Additionally, we incorporated a jitter to simulate visual instability encountered in actual
      flights, enhancing the realism of our training data.</p>
