              <p>Leading a national-level Student Research Training Program (SRTP) titled "Vision-Based Object Tracking for UAV," 
              I orchestrated the development of a complete UAV system by integrating key components: mapping, planning, 
              target recognition, localization, and control. Building upon FastLab's Elastic tracker as a foundation, 
              I have enhanced the robustness of the recognition algorithm.</p>

   <h2>Hierarchical Multi-goal Path Finding</h2>
  <div class="center">
      <img  width="480" height="360" src="https://github.com/mengze3/mengze3.github.io/blob/d329c78ee436329701cc9e32fb3e3280a55856a0/_pages/srtp1.PNG?raw=true" alt="">
  </div>
    <p>This subsection addresses the challenge of finding an efficient path for the drone that not only reaches the target but also considers potential obstacles and occlusion issues.
This is a hierarchical method that first identifies multiple goals or waypoints that the drone should reach to maintain visibility of the target. These goals are selected based on their distance to the target and potential occlusion.
A greedy algorithm is employed to enhance the efficiency of the path-finding process. This algorithm ensures that the path is not only safe and visible but also computationally feasible for real-time applications.</p>


   <h2>Safe Flight Corridor Generation</h2>
  <div class="center">
      <img  width="480" height="360" src="https://github.com/mengze3/mengze3.github.io/blob/d329c78ee436329701cc9e32fb3e3280a55856a0/_pages/srtp2.PNG?raw=true" alt="">
  </div>
    <p>This section discusses the generation of a safe flight corridor (SFC) that the drone can follow without colliding with obstacles.
Previous methods in safe flight corridor generation often faced limitations, especially in complex environments where the drone must maneuver through tight spaces or avoid moving obstacles.
I utilize a novel approach to generate a more flexible and safer corridor, which adapts to the environment and the drone's dynamic constraints, ensuring a higher level of safety during flight.</p>


     <h2>Visible Region Generation</h2>
  <div class="center">
      <img  width="480" height="360" src="https://github.com/mengze3/mengze3.github.io/blob/d329c78ee436329701cc9e32fb3e3280a55856a0/_pages/srtp3.PNG?raw=true" alt="">
  </div>
    <p>The aim here is to ensure that the drone maintains a line of sight to the target during the tracking mission.
A key contribution of this subsection is the development of a sector-shaped visible region for each predicted position of the target.
This visible region is designed to account for potential occlusions and to guide the drone in maintaining an optimal position for visibility. 
      It is a crucial part of the system, ensuring that the target remains within the drone's field of view throughout the tracking process.</p>
