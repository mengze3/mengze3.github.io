    <h1>Neural Path Planning</h1>

    <p>A neural network path planner was proposed to learn data for trajectory optimization. It reads information from maps and poses. The structure is divided into three layers: 
      feature extraction layer, global distribution layer, and local correction layer. The feature extraction layer is used to extract information from maps and poses; 
      the global distribution layer aims to locate the general area of the path; the local correction layer focuses on finding the precise locations of these path points in the area. 
      This approach has three advantages. First, because it is a neural network, its inference speed is relatively stable. Second, the neural network size can be made very small, enhancing its efficiency. 
      Third, since it learns data from backend trajectory optimization, it takes into account the process of backend trajectory optimization, 
      providing a better initial value for the backend. I have applied this method on Ackerman vehicles and achieved certain results.</p>

    <h1>Fixed-Wing Long-Range Covert Flight </h1>
    <div class="center">
      <img  width="840" height="540" src="https://github.com/mengze3/mengze3.github.io/blob/11d20e3403392d78c85e76b223132dde30c84f6a/_pages/model1.png?raw=true" alt="">
  </div>
<p>The generation of global trajectories for fixed-wing aircraft follows a hierarchical framework. Initially, a sampling-based dynamic path planning algorithm is used, 
  targeting exploration within the global environment to find a better path topology. The paths generated in this step are not smooth and may not be entirely dynamically feasible. 
  To address this issue, a numerical optimization-based algorithm is employed to further optimize the output of the previous step in the continuous state space. 
  This ensures stealth in flight while effectively improving the smoothness and dynamic feasibility of the trajectory. 
  Due to the order of magnitude difference in the map size and the altitude range of the aircraft, the trajectory planning problem is modeled as a two-dimensional trajectory generation problem. 
  Here, the aircraft is set to maintain a constant altitude of 60 meters, 
  with a flight speed of 150 meters per second. Mountainous terrains on the map exceeding 60 meters in height are treated as impassable obstacles.</p>
    
   <h2>Sampling-Based Global Covert Rough Path Planning</h2>
  <div class="center">
      <img  width="480" height="360" src="https://github.com/mengze3/mengze3.github.io/blob/96a2010660a9e880b3ac05d6ee48315dbfe4d0c5/_pages/rrt.png?raw=true" alt="">
  </div>
    <p>In the application of this project, it is necessary to specially design the loss function. To ensure covert flight, 
      the loss function needs to be specifically designed based on the level of concealment provided by the environment, making covert paths more likely to be selected and integrated into the optimal trajectory.
      To achieve this effect, the project proposes to first conduct terrain estimation. During sampling, the terrain difference will be integrated along the trajectory between sampled state points to assess the level of concealment of the terrain. 
      Here, the terrain difference will be defined as the elevation difference within a prescribed square area centered on the state points.</p>


   <h2>Gradient-Based Efficient Trajectory Optimization</h2>

    <p>This section discusses the generation of a safe flight corridor (SFC) that the drone can follow without colliding with obstacles.
Previous methods in safe flight corridor generation often faced limitations, especially in complex environments where the drone must maneuver through tight spaces or avoid moving obstacles.
I utilize a novel approach to generate a more flexible and safer corridor, which adapts to the environment and the drone's dynamic constraints, ensuring a higher level of safety during flight.</p>


     <h2>Simulation Verification</h2>

    <p>The aim here is to ensure that the drone maintains a line of sight to the target during the tracking mission.
A key contribution of this subsection is the development of a sector-shaped visible region for each predicted position of the target.
This visible region is designed to account for potential occlusions and to guide the drone in maintaining an optimal position for visibility. 
      It is a crucial part of the system, ensuring that the target remains within the drone's field of view throughout the tracking process.</p>

    <p>  A formidable obstacle surfaced: the low accuracy of image recognition, attributed to inadequate data stemming from the diverse scenes encountered during UAV flights.</p>

    <p>    To tackle this challenge, we implemented innovative measures to augment our dataset. Recording videos enabled us to capture dynamic UAV images in flight, 
      expanding the range of perspectives and scenarios for more diverse training data. Additionally, we incorporated a jitter to simulate visual instability encountered in actual
      flights, enhancing the realism of our training data.</p>

    <p>    Through persistent efforts and optimization, our image recognition accuracy experienced a substantial boost, with recall rates increasing from 36% to 97% and precision surging from 68% to 98%.
      This remarkable improvement has significantly bolstered the robustness of our robot tracking. Particularly noteworthy is that when the confidence (threshold) is set at 0.5, 
      the system demonstrates exceptionally high reliability and efficiency.</p>

    <p>The left side of the image shows examples of objects identified by the trained model, while the right side displays charts of various training metrics. 
      These charts include changes in the loss function, as well as variations in evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and mean Average Precision (mAP).</p>
    <p>Loss Function: The train/box_loss, train/obj_loss, train/cls_loss, and corresponding validation set losses val/box_loss, val/obj_loss, 
      val/cls_loss all show a gradual decrease with increasing training epochs, indicating that the model is progressively improving, learning to better identify and classify objects.</p>
    <p>Precision and Recall: The metrics/precision and metrics/recall charts show that both these metrics are high, close to 1.0, 
      indicating that the model can correctly identify most true positives and rarely misclassifies negatives as positives.</p>
    <p>Mean Average Precision (mAP): The metrics/mAP_0.5 and metrics/mAP_0.5:0.95 represent the mAP at IoU (Intersection over Union) thresholds of 0.5 and between 0.5 to 0.95, respectively. 
      Both of these metrics also exhibit high values, especially the metrics/mAP_0.5 is near perfect, signifying that the model performs well across different IoU thresholds</p>
